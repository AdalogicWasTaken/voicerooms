# voicerooms
This is an inactive project.

For anyone who wishes to fork this, the idea was to make a Discord bot that could create voice chats on-demand, with settings like a user limit and even features like voice-chat ownership and requiring passwords to join specific voice channels.

I may or may not revisit this project sometime in the future. For now, it will remain archived.
