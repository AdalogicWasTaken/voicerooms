# voicerooms
This is an inactive project. <br />
For anyone who wishes to fork this, the idea was to make a Discord bot that could create voice chats on-demand, with settings like a user limit and even features like voice-chat ownership and requiring passwords to join specific voice channels. <br />
I may or may not revisit this project sometime in the future. For now, it will remain archived.
